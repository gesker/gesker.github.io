## Technology Portfolio

Candela Global is primarily a holding company for technologies developed by Dennis, his associates and clients.

Recently the intellectual property portfolio submitted two patent applications relating
to [revealed economic behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revealed-preference.asp) in social media systems
and
integrating [consensus based](https://hacken.io/discover/consensus-mechanisms/) [blockchain technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
with traditional [relational database systems](https://www.ibm.com/topics/relational-databases). These new portfolio
holdings are embodied in US Patent filing numbers 18/323408 and 18/323409 and the demonstrator technology code was
implemented in [Java](https://java.com)/[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using
the [K3s](https://k3s.io/) implementation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
